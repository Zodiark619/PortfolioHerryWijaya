Instead of giving someone a piece of your mind, give someone peace of your mind.
Spread love, not hate.
If you care enough for a result, you will most certainly attain it.
Believe in yourself.
Patience is the best remedy for every trouble.
Go for a walk. Sit down and watch the clouds go by. In today’s digital age of instant gratification, consciously slow down and let life happen.
Don’t ever slam a door; you might want to go back.
Treat others how you’d like to be treated, and all doors will stay open.
Effort and courage are not enough without purpose and direction.
Know what you want…
Success is living up to your potential. That is all.
